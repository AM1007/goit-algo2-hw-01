# Homework on the Topic: "Algorithm Analysis. Divide and Conquer Strategy"

Welcome to your first homework assignment! ðŸ™‚ Howâ€™s your mood?

Today, you will practice applying algorithms correctly to specific tasks, which is crucial for developing efficient programs. This assignment will help you reinforce your understanding of the "Divide and Conquer" algorithmic approach.

The homework consists of two independent tasks: one mandatory and one optional.

***

# Task 1 (Mandatory): Finding the Maximum and Minimum Elements

Implement a function that finds the maximum and minimum elements in an array using the "Divide and Conquer" method.

## Acceptance Criteria

ðŸ“Œ The acceptance criteria are mandatory for the mentor to review your assignment. If any of the criteria are not met, the mentor will return the assignment for revision without evaluation. If you need "just a clarification" ðŸ˜‰ or you're "stuck" at some stage, feel free to ask your mentor in Slack.

- The function accepts an array of numbers of arbitrary length.
- A recursive approach is used.
- The function returns a tuple of values (minimum, maximum).
- The algorithmâ€™s time complexity is O(n).

***

# Task 2 (Optional): Finding the k-th Smallest Element*

Implement an algorithm to find the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array using the Quick Select method.

## Conditions

- The function must accept an array of numbers and a number k.
- The approach must use a pivot selection strategy.
- The array should not be fully sorted.
- The expected average-case time complexity should be O(n).

ðŸ“Œ Note: Quick Select is an example of the "Divide and Conquer" method, but in this case, the Combine step does not require additional work. Once we find the required element, we simply return it.
